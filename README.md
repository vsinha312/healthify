# Healthify

An application built on the Flutter framework to cater to one's health needs. This app provides you with your current BMI, and if underweight/overweight, this app lets you set targets to get fit by providing the data of the required number of calories that one must consume in a day in order to reach the required BMI. The value of the calorie that one must consume daily is computed by taking weight, age, height, gender and daily activity level into account. Moreover, the users can also watch their progress to keep themselves motivated.
